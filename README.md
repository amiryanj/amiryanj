### My name is Javad, et je m'appelle the Father of Robots :)

- ðŸ”­ Right now (2023-2024) Iâ€™m a postdoc researcher:
  * at [Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics (ISIR)](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/) at Sorbonne University
  * where I work on **Social Robot Navigation**
  * and also learning about **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**.

- ðŸŽ“ I completed my PhD (2018-2021):
  * on **Human Motion Prediction** and **Crowd Simulation** for the navigation of robots
  * It was part of an -almost- big European H2020 research project, called **CrowdBot**
  * at French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA)
  * You can find some of the source codes for this research here: https://github.com/crowdbotp

- ðŸ¤– I've been working on various robotics and AI projects since 2009 and have been a proud father to many small robots who:
  * Follow simple lines (2008-2009)
  * Play soccer (Robocup SSL) (2010-2015)
  * Collect Tennis balls ([Vive Tennis](https://www.vivetennis.com)) (2021-2023)
